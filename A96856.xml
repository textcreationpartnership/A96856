Vnto which is annexed a necessary and essential appendix, very well worth the readers, carefull perusal; if he desire rightly to understand the whole body of the discourse, and know the worth of that ner'e enough to be prised, bulwork of English freedom, viz. to be tried by a jury of legal and good men of the neighbour-hood. / Published by Theodorus Verax.</title>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Sir will it pleaſe you to hear me, and if ſo, By your favour thus. All the priviledge for my part that I ſhall crave this day at your hands is no more, but that which is properly, and ſingly the Liberty of every Free-borne <hi>Engliſhman; viz.</hi> The benifit of the Lawes and Liberties thereof, which by my Birth-right and Inheritance, is due unto me; the which I have fought for as well as others have done, with a ſingle and upright heart; and if I cannot have and injoy this, I ſhall leave this Teſtimony behind me, that I dyed for the Lawes and Liberties of this Nation; and upon this ſcore I ſtand, and if I periſh I periſh. And if the fact that I have done, cannot be juſtified by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> let me periſh; I mention none of this for the gaining of mercy, or by way of merit, no I ſcotne it; for mercy I crave from none but from the hands of my God alone, with whom I hope, and am aſſured one day to reſt; whom I have ſet before my eyes, and ſo walked, as believing I am alwaies in his preſence, in whoſe power my confidence is fixed, whom I take and own to be my ſtay, my ſtafe, my ſtrength and ſupport, and in whom I reſt as the life of my life, and whom I hope to meet with joy, when this fading and uncertaine life ſhall have an end, to live with him in glory and bleſſedneſſe for evermore. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe I would not willingly trouble you with many words, to cauſe you to ſpend your time impertinently; therefore Sir, in reference to the Court, I ſhall crave but ſo much liberty from you as was given to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he pleaded for his life before the Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Judges, which was free liberty of ſpeech to ſpeak for himſelf, the which I now humbly crave
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165485:3"/>as my right, not onely by the Law of God and man, but alſo by the Law &amp; light of Nature; And I ſhall do it with that reſpect, reaſon and judgement, that doth become a man that knows what it is to plead for his life. I hope God hath given me ability to be maſter of my own paſſion, and indowed me with that reaſon, that will dictate unto me what is for my own good and benefit.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeverall times been arraigned for my life already. I was once ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned before the Houſe of Peers for (ſticking cloſe to the Liberties, and Priviledges of this Nation, and thoſe that ſtood for them) being one of thoſe two or three men, that firſt drew their Swords in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall againſt Col. <hi>Lunsford</hi> and ſome ſcores of his aſſociates. At that time, it was ſuppoſed, they intended to cut the throats of the chiefeſt men then ſitting in the Houſe of Commons; I ſay for this, and other things of the like nature, I was arraigned by the Kings ſpeciall Command and Order, the 1. of <hi>May</hi> 1641. I mention it to this end, that when I came before the Houſe of Peers, where was about three or foureſcore Lords then ſitting at the beginning of the Parliament; (who then were ſuppoſed the moſt arbitrary of any power in <hi>England</hi>) yet I had from them free liberty of ſpeech, to ſpeak for my life at their Barr, without check or controll in the beſt manner, all thoſe abilities God had given me would inable me; and when I was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I was again arraigned as a Traytor before the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Heath,</hi> for levying Warre at the Command of the then Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament againſt the perſon of the King; and when I came before him in the <hi>Guild</hi>-Hall of <hi>Oxford,</hi> he told me (there being preſent with him (as his fellow Judge) Mr <hi>Gardiner</hi> (ſometimes Recorder of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) now Sir <hi>Thomas Gardiner,</hi> and others that ſat by a ſpeciall Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> from the King; the which Commiſſion I did not ſo well then underſtand, as I hope I do now. And my Lord Chiefe Juſtice <hi>Heath</hi> ſtood up, &amp; in the face of all the Court, &amp; in the face of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try preſent there told me, Capt. <hi>Lilburne</hi> you are brought here before us for High Treaſon, for leavying Warre in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> againſt your Soveraigne Lord and King; and though you be now in a Garriſon, and were taken in Armes in open hoſtility againſt the King (yea Sir, and I muſt now tell you in ſuch hoſtility, that we were but about 700. men at <hi>Branford</hi> that withſtood the Kings whole Army in the field, about five houres together, and fought it out to the very Swords point, and to the Butt end of the Musket; and thereby hindred the King from his then poſſeſſing the Parliaments Train of Artillery, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the City of <hi>London,</hi> in which very act I was taken a priſoner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Articles or capitulation, and was by the King and his party then lookt upon, as one of the activeſt men againſt them in the whole company) yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165485:4"/>ſaid Judge <hi>Heath,</hi> we will not take advantage of that, to try you by the rules of arbitrary Marſhall Law, or any other arbitrary waies; but we will try you by the rules of the good old Lawes of <hi>England;</hi> and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Priviledge in your Tryall the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> will afford you, claim it as your Birth-right and Inheritance, and you ſhall injoy it, with as much freedom and willingneſſe, as if you were in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, to be tryed amongſt your own party; and this we will do for that end, that ſo at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> your friends ſhall not have any juſt cauſe to ſay, we murdered you with cruelty, or denied you the benefit of the Law, in taking away your life by the rules of our own Wills. Nay, further ſaid he, Capt. <hi>Lilburn,</hi> it is true, I am a Judge made by my Soveraigne Lord the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his right by<note n="†" place="margin">See the <hi>27.</hi> of <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> chap. <hi>24.</hi>

Yea, &amp; to exhort him to anſwer without fear, if he perceive him daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or amazed at the preſence of the Court; yea it is my duty, to carry my ſelf with all fairneſs and evenneſs of hand towards you; And wherein that there ſhall ſeeme any miſtakes to appear, in circumſtances or formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to rectifie you; For it's my duty to help you, and not to uſe any boiſterous, or rough language to you in the leaſt, to put you in fear, or any wayes prevent the freedom of your defence: and according to the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> this is my duty, and this is the Law. And accordingly he gave me liberty to plead to the errors of my Indictment, before ever I Pleaded not Guilty, yea and alſo became willing to aſſigne me what Councell, I pleaſed, to nominate, freely to come to priſon to me, and to conſult and adviſe with me and helpe me in point of Law; This laſt he did immediatly upon my Pleading to the Indictment before any fact was proved; all which is conſonant to the Declared Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sir EDWAD COOKE, that great Oracle of the Laws of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> whoſe Bookes are Publiſhed by ſpeciall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

                  <p>Truly, Sir, I being now come before you to anſwer for my life, and being no profeſſed Lawyer, may through my own ignorance of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick part of the Law, eſpecially in the Formalities, Niſities and Puntillios thereof, run my ſelfe with over-much haſtineſſe, in ſnares and dangers that I ſhall not eaſily get out of. And therefore being all of a ſudden bid to hold up my hand at the Barre, I cannot chuſe but a little demurre upon it, and yet with all reſpect to you, to declare my deſirableneſſe to keep within the bounds of Reaſon, Moderation and Diſcretion, and ſo to carry my ſelfe as it doth become a man that knowes what it is to anſwer for his life.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in the firſt place, I have ſomething to ſay to the Court about the firſt Fundamentall liberty of an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in order to his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which is, that by the Lawes of this Land, all Courts of Iuſtice alwayes ought to be free and open for all ſorts of peaceable people to ſee, behold, and heare, and have free acceſſe unto: and no man whatſoever ought to be tried in holes or corners, or in any place where the gates are ſhut and bar'd, and guarded with armed men: and yet, Sir, as I came in, I found the gates ſhut and guarded; which is contrary both to Law and Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Sir, the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> and the Priviledges thereof, are my Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance and Birth-right: And, Sir, I muſt acquaint you, that I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſummoned before a Committee of Parliament, where Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> and ſeverall others have had the Chaire; and there I ſtood upon my right by the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> and refuſed to proceed with the ſaid Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, till by ſpeciall order they cauſed their Dores to be wide thrown open, that the people might have free and un-interrupted acceſſe to heare, ſee, and conſider of what they ſaid to me, although I think the pretence that I am now brought before you for, be the very ſame in ſubſtance, that I was convened before Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> for, which was about Bookes: and I am ſure there I did argue the caſe with him and the reſt of the Committee ſoundly out in Law, proving that they were bound in Law and Iuſtice, freely to open their Dores, for the free acceſſe of all ſorts and kindes of auditors: And I did refuſe (as of right) to proceed with them, till by ſpeciall order they did open their Dores. For no triall in ſuch caſes, ought to be in any place, unleſſe it be publick, open and free; and therefore if you pleaſe that I may enjoy that Legall Right and Priviledge which was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165485:5"/>granted unto me by Mr. <hi>Miles Corbet,</hi> and the reſt of that Committee, (when I was brought before them in the like caſe that now I am brought before you:) which priviledge I know to be my right by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall, as it becomes an underſtanding <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> (who in his actions hates deeds of darkneſſe, holes or corners) goe on to a triall. But if I be denied this undoubted priviledge, I ſhall rather die here than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further. And therefore foreſeeing this before hand, and being willing to provide againſt all jealouſies of my eſcape, the feare of which I ſuppoſed might be objected againſt me as a ground to deny me this my le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal right; and therefore before hand I have given my engagement to the Lieutenant of the Tower, that I will be a faithfull and true priſoner to him.</p>
                  <p>And I hope the Gentleman hath ſo much experience of my faithfulneſs to my word, that he doth not in the leaſt queſtion or ſcruple it; I am ſure he hath often ſo declared to me that he doth not.</p>
                  <p>Nay, I have not onely ingaged to be a true priſoner in the Tower to him, but I have alſo ſolemnly ingaged to him, that I will come civilly and peaceably with him; and that I will go civilly and peaceably back with him again. And that if any tumult or up-roare ſhall ariſe in the croud, of which I loſe him, and he me; or in caſe I ſhould be any wayes by force &amp; power reſcued from him, I have alſo faithfully ingaged to him, that I will come again to him (by the aſſiſtance of God) as ſoon as ever I can get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from that force or reſcue. And all this I intreated him to acquaint you with, that all jealouſies and diſputes might be avoided.</p>

                  <p>Well then, Sir, I am ſatisfied as to that. But then in the next place, I have read the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> I have read <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Lawes made in confirmation of it; and I have alſo read the <hi>Act that aboliſheth the Star-chamber,</hi> which was made in the yeare 1641. which laſt recited Act expreſly confirmes thoſe ſtratures that were made in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time, which declares all Acts, Laws and Statutes that were made againſt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> to be null and void in Law, and holden for error.</p>
                  <p>In the reading of which Lawes I doe not find a ſpeciall Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> to be Legall and warrantable.

An extream Out-cry of the Houſe of Commons, againſt ſpecial Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> with a great deal of bitterneſs and vehemency, as may fully and clearly be read in that excellent Argument of Mr. <hi>Hide, April</hi> 1641.

                  <p>The originall reaſon or occaſion of which he there declares to be thus, that by reaſon of the ſuppreſſion of the Abbies in the 27. of <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time; In the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (through diſcontent thereat) there did ariſe from the ſaid 27. yeare to the 30. no fewer then ſix grand inſurrections, moſt of them under the Command of ſome eminent man of thoſe Countries, which Inſurrections &amp; Rebellions occaſioned the leavying of great Armies which had like to have ſet the whole Kingdom in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall flame; for the ſuppreſſing and preventing of which in future times

                  <p>And therefore Sir, admit my actions in their tendancy to be as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and hainous as any of my adverſaries can imagine or declare them to be, yet they are but in the aſhes, but in the harth, they are not broke out into viſible and violent hoſtile actions; and therefore I ſay, if ſpecial Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> granted in ſuch ſpecial and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent caſes as thoſe in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. time were illegal, much more muſt a ſpecial Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> granted to try me barely for words, or at moſt, for pretended Writings or Books, at ſuch a time when there is no burning flame of Inſurrections or Rebellions in the Kingdom, but all in viſible peace, and all the ordinary Courts of Juſtice open, and I and my Friends have often ſought to enjoy the benefit of the Law in a Legal Trial, from firſt to laſt, but could never enjoy it in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, although many Sizes and Seſſions have paſt over my head ſince my firſt Commitment, now ſeven moneths ago, at the firſt of which, in the County where my pretended crime was committed, I ought by Law and Juſtice either to be tryed or acquitted; ſo that Sir, by what I have already ſaid, you may ſee the judgement and opinion of the Houſe of Commons upon ſpecial Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> in their firſt purity, when

                  <p>And although no crime in Law (which ought to be particularly expreſſed) was laid unto my charge, yet when I was firſt impriſoned, there were thouſands of my friends (well wiſhers to the freedomes of <hi>England,</hi> and to the common cauſe in which they had been ingaged in for theſe eight yeares together) both old and young, both maſters of families, young men and apprentiſes, and abundance of others of the feminine ſex too, with abundance of cordiall honeſt men in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Countries, joyned in ſeverall rationall and fair petitions, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to the Houſe in the behalfe of my ſelfe and my three fellow Priſoners; in which they moſt earneſtly intreated them, that they would not prejudge us before we were heard, and knew our accuſers and accuſations; but rather that they would releaſe us, and take off their prejudgeing Votes againſt us, which they had cauſed to be proclaimed in all the publique places of the Nation againſt us, and let us have a fair and Legall Triall according to the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> and according to the undenyable Priviledges of the due proceſſe of the Law from firſt to laſt, and they would put in any ſecurity that they would require of them, that we ſhould be forthcomming at all times, to anſwer whatſoever in Law could be laid to our charge; unto all which petitions which were very many, they could get no manner of ſatisfying anſwer, but ſlights, abuſes, and ſcornes.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this Gentlemen, that you may ſee that I am rationall, and that you may ſee I have an innocent and quiet Conſcience within me, that does not accuſe me nor rerrifie me, therefore I muſt acquaint you that I again and again proffered my chiefeſt Adverſaries, and ſent often to them, being earneſtly deſitous to chuſe two Members of the Houſe of Commons, and let them chuſe two more whom they pleaſed, and I would withall my heart freely refer all manner of difference betwixt them and me, to the finall determination and judgement of four of their fellow Members; but all this would do no good, and yet they would not in the leaſt let me underſtand what was the thing they deſired of me, but by their Power and Will, I had my pockets and Chamber ſearched to find out advantages againſt me, and alſo lock'd up cloſe Priſoner, with Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells night and day ſet at my door, and denyed the acceſſe and ſight of my Wife and Children for ſome certain time, and for about twenty weeks together in the heat of ſummer, kept cloſe Priſoner, and denyed the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Priſon, and my eſtate with a ſtrong hand taken away from me, without any pretence (or due proceſs) of Law, to the value of almoſt three thouſand pounds, that was Legally and juſtly inveſted in me, and in my

                  <p>Truly ſirs, I appeal to your own judgements and to your Conſciences, and to all the people that hear me this day, whether all theſe provocations laid upon a poor man which is but duſt and aſhes, as well as other men, be not too inſupportable a burden, and too much for the cauſers of them to take advantage of the fruits produced by them, to deſtroy me, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my life.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Sir, in the firſt place I ſhall humbly crave that favour and right, ſeeing I am brought before you by a piece of parchment that truly I could not read, neither could he do it that ſhwed it me, (I mean the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Tower) for admit that if I did well underſtand Latine, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I do not, onely ſome ordinary words, yet was it in ſuch an unuſual ſtrange hand that I could not read it; and therefore being I am brought before you implicitly, and not as I conceive an Engliſhman ought to be, who ought to ſee and read the Authority by vertue of which he is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before any power: Its true, I know ſome of you Gentlemen that I ſee ſit before me, yet not many of you, and truly I have nothing but a piece of un-legeable Parchment, which cannot ſatisfie my underſtanding of the Legalneſſe of my convention before you, but being I am not able to diſpute that Power that compulſively brought me, but here I am, and therefore in order to the declaring of my ſelf to be a true Engliſhman, I moſt humbly crave (and that I think is conſonant to reaſon, and I hope to Law too) that I may ſee and hear read, the Commiſſion by vertue of which you ſit here this day, and convene my Perſon before you, that ſo I may compare it to the Law, and conſider whether or no that by my pleading before you by vertue of it, I do not betray my liberties; and rherefore I humbly crave that you would let me hear your Commiſſion read; for this Court is no ordinary and common Aſſizes, Seſſions, or Goal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivery, the onely proper Courts for trying me for all criminal faults, yea and thoſe alſo ought to ſit where the Crimes are committed; and I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for a pretended Crime, pretended to be committed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Surry;</hi> where by the common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and expreſſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, I ought to be tryed therefore, and no where elſe.</p>

The next thing you are upon, is the wrong and injuſtice that you received by the proceedings in the Star-chamber againſt you, you ſee the proceedings there have been queſtioned, and you juſtified; if there be any thing elſe that hath been by others in the North or elſewhere acted, there is no man here that will juſtifie them in their evil, but for a private man as you are to tell us of them here, and to come and tell us to our faces that we are Created and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Atturny General, we will not ſuffer it, nor further hear of it; and therefore M.</hi> Lilburn <hi>although you have ſpoken fair words, (and happily more then your friends expected from you) I muſt tell you that words are but words, and it were well that you would do as well and as Rationally as becomes a Rational man, as you have declared you will.</hi>

                     <hi>M.</hi> Lilburn, <hi>pray ſpare a word, and hear the Court, this Court ſits here by lawful Authority, and that is from the Parliament, that are the Supreme Authority of</hi> England, <hi>ſo that our Power is not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from thoſe that have no Rightful Authority to conſtitute us, but our Power is from the Publick Authority of</hi> England, <hi>which is now by an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable act of Gods providence, lately, but truly revived, and ſettled by God upon them. By that Authority this Court doth now ſit, and you are brought here before them that are moſt of us Judges of the Law, and we are ſworn to do you and every man juſtice and right according as his cauſe requires; according to Law, Judgement, equity, and reaſon. And it was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:165485:11"/>ſaid truly, that which my brother</hi> Heath <hi>(who now is dead) did ſay, Its the the duty of the Judges to be of Councel with the Priſoner, at the Bar before him, and to do that which they are ſworn to do, and that you ſhall have; and accordingly you have received more favour then ever I heard, of a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that was accuſed of Treaſon in my life ever had. And as for the Commiſſion, I muſt tell you, it is uſual to have Commiſſions of</hi> Oyer <hi>and</hi> Terminer, <hi>and that even in Terme time for high offences, and ſuch as tend to the deſtruction of the Nation, as</hi> Overburies <hi>did; and thoſe that tend to Capital Treaſon, whereof you are now accuſed by a Grand-jury of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>that are Free-men of</hi> London, <hi>Citizens, able men, men of Religion, men of Eſtate, men of Conſcience, men of quality, theſe are your accuſers; who have found you upon their Oaths guilty of Treaſon, and cry out to us the Judges for juſtice againſt you; and it is they, not we that proceeds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you: And as for our Commiſſion, it is according to the good old Laws of the Land, founded upon the Statute made in</hi> Edward <hi>the firſts time, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Weſtminſter the ſecond: <hi>That Statute Authorizeth Commiſſions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Commiſſion we ſit by here this day; and</hi> Edward <hi>the firſt was a wiſe and a good Prince, and conſented to the People, to let them have ſuch Commiſſions as ours we ſit by is, which the People had fought ſtoutly for, in the Barrons wars in his Fathers time, and alſo in his, for he himſelfe was taken Priſoner at</hi> Lewes <hi>in the County of</hi> Suſſex; <hi>and being a wiſe Prince, he knew that the love of the people was not more to be got then by wholſome and ſafe lawes; that every mans life, and every mans eſtate, and every mans liberty might be preſerved by, and not be ſubject to any Arbitrary Will or Power, but that the ſober and diſcreet and wiſe Lawes of the Kingdome, which our Anceſtors won by their ſwords, might be their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors; a ſpeciall, one of which was this Statute of</hi> Weſtminſter the ſecond <hi>made in</hi> Edward <hi>the Firſts time; by vertue of which Statute is this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion directed to the Juſtices of the one Bench and the other, and they be all here this day; but onely thoſe that of neceſſity muſt attend at</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, <hi>onely to preſerve the Terme. Nou you are come to anſwer to that Charge, which hath been the greateſt oppoſition to the ſettlement of Government that can be, I mean, the ſettlement of the Supreme Authority of the Nation, in the Commons now aſſembled in Parliament, not newly erected but revived into the right place and hands, for it is the Law of</hi> England <hi>revived, that the Supreme Authority is in the</hi>

                     <hi>Commons aſſembled in the Parliament
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:165485:12"/>of England: For ſo it was in the Saxons time, and in the Romans time, and in all times</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">But there was before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt neither Innes of Court, Lawyers, nor Term Iudges in England, but onely twelve good and legal men, choſen in each Hundred, finally to decide all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies; which laſted till <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conqueror ſubdued that excellent Conſtitution, and inſtead thereof, introduced by His Will and Sword (contrary to His So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath three ſeveral times ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) the intolerable bondage of Weſtminſter Hall, or Term Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and their Outlandiſh or Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law Practiſe in the French Tongue; as all the Engliſh Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles univerſally and truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</note>

                  <p>That Gentleman I do not know his Name, (pointing to Judge <hi>Iarmen</hi>) you were pleaſed to ſay that I have had more Favour then ever you have heard of any before ever had in the like caſe: But Sir, by your Favour, I ſhall tell you of ſome that in the like caſe have had as much, if not more, and that was <hi>Throgmorton</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, who was impeached of higher Treaſon than now I am, and that in the daies of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accounted bloudieſt and cruelleſt Prince that this many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years hath reigned in England; and yet Sir, I am ſure in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:165485:12"/>this very place, and that by ſpecial Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner;</hi> who was accuſed for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the chiefeſt Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with <hi>Wyat</hi> in his Kentiſh Rebellion; which <hi>Wyat</hi> marched with an Army againſt the Queen to <hi>London,</hi> for which actual War or Rebellion, <hi>Throgmorton</hi> was in this place arraigned as a Traytor, and enjoyed as much, if not more favor then I have now enjoyed, although his then Judges and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter were bent to take away<note n="*" place="margin">Whoſe remarkable and excellent Defence, you may at large read in <hi>Hollingſheads</hi> Chronicle, in the life of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> which diſcourſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well worth the ſpeedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing, eſpecially ſeeing men are made Traytors for words; which cruelty Q. <hi>Mary</hi> abhorred, as may cleerly be read in that excellent Statute of his, made in the firſt yeer of Her Reigne, Chap. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <p>I have here at the Bar given in many ſtrong Arguments againſt the validity and legality of a ſpecial Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi> and ſuppoſing that to be ſuch an one by vertue of which you ſit, and intend to try me for my life; and therefore I have humbly deſired (as in reaſon, and I think in law I may juſtly do) to hear your Commiſſion read; But you have poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed me that, and therefore I deſire all my Friends, and all the people that hear me this day, to bear witneſs and take notice, that you contrary to Reaſon and common Equity, denyed me to let me hear read your Commiſſion by Vertue of which you go about to take away my life; which I cannot chuſe but deſire them to take notice, I declare to be very hard meaſure.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, to ſave my ſelf from your fore-lay'd ſhares, and deſired advantage againſt me, I will come a little cloſer to the buſineſs: You demand I ſhould hold up my hand at the Bar, and I know not what it meanes, neither what in law it ſignifies; Its true, I have read the moſt part of the lawes that are in Engliſh, which I take to be the Foundation of all our Engliſh legal Priviledges, and in them I cannot find any thing that doth cleerly declare unto me the full ſignification or meaning of a mans holding up his hand at the Bar; Therefore if you pleaſe but to explain what the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:165485:13"/>meaning and ſignification of holding up the hand at the Barre is, I ſhall ſeriouſly conſider of it, and I hope returne you a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and diſcreet anſwer; for truly in thoſe lawes which are in the Engliſh Tongue that I have read, although I find mentioned maid of holding up the hand, yet I cannnt finde much of the full ſignification of it, onely I finde it to be of a large extent; and as for thoſe lawes, or rather the practick part of the law, that are in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Lattin,</hi> I cannot read them, and therefore much leſſe underſtand them; in which regard, for me to hold up my hand at the Barre, before I underſtand the true ſignification of it in law, (which tells me it is in it ſelfe a tickliſh thing) were for me to throw away my own life upon a puntillio or nicity, that I am ignorant of; and therfore truly I think I ſhould be a very fool in my own ignorance to run that danger, &amp; therefore Sir., I humbly deſire the clear explination of the meaning of it in law, &amp; after that I ſhal give you a fair &amp; rational anſwer.</p>

By the Law of</hi> England, <hi>that you deſire to have the meaning of it, is but juſt but you muſt know that the Law of</hi> England <hi>is the Law of God, and if there be any thing in the Law
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:165485:13"/>of</hi> England <hi>but what was by admirable Conſtitution and Reaſon, we would not meddle with it; but I pray know this, that the Law of</hi> England <hi>is no written Law, it is the Law that hath been maintained by our Anceſtors, by the tryed rules of Reaſon, and the prime Lawes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for it does not depend upon ſtatutes or written and declared words</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">But ſaith M. <hi>Hyde</hi> in his fore-mentioned Argument, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Northerne ſpecial Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi> pag. <hi>411.

                  <p>Truely, Sir, I am upon my life, and ſhall my ignorance of the formalities of the law in the practicke part thereof deſtroy me, God forbid! therefore give me but leave to ſpeak for my life, or elſe knock me on the head, and murther me where I ſtand, which is more righteous and juſt then to doe it by pretence of Juſtice. Sir, I know that Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> himſelfe, Preſident to the high Court of Juſtice, as it was called, gave Duke <hi>Hamilton (a hoſtile enimy)</hi> leave to ſpeak to the punctilltos of the law; yea, and to my knowledg again and again made an engagement unto him and the reſt tryed with him, that the Court nor he would not by vertue of their ignorance of the meeties or forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the law, take advantage againſt them to deſtroy them; but did declare again and again that all advantages of formalities ſhould be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally laid aſide, and not in the leaſt made uſe of againſt them to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and I hope you will grant me, that have often beene in Armes for you, but never againſt you, as much favour and priviledge as was granted to Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> never of your party, but a Generall of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army againſt you.</p>

By your allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you ſay, you had counſell aſſigned you before any matter of fact came to be proved, when as a Judg of the law he could not but do it; but if he did it is nothing to us, we cannot do it; yet we have in this place proceeded legally hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto with you, &amp; when that matter of law doth ariſe from the fact, as you had counſell there aſſigned you, ſo ſhall you have here, &amp; you ſhal have faire dealing, &amp; fair play according to law, which is abſolutely as I tell you.</hi>

And it is a wonderfull ſtrange thing to me, That when the Priſoner hath pleaded the uſuall way, you proceed not immediately to tryall, its true Mr.</hi> Lilburne <hi>hath pleaded his own ignorance, and therefore deſires longer time; but my Lord, to make a Preſident of this nature that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was known by the Lawes of</hi> England <hi>is very dangerous, very perilous. My Lord, the things that I preſſe is not in relation to time, but in relation to the publique Juſtice; for by the ſame reaſon its granted him, it ought not to be denyed to any man that asketh it, neither for Treaſon or Felleny, and of what evill conſequence it would be, I leave your Lordſhip and the Court to judge.</hi>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:165485:24"/>and no mans life ſurprized or taken away by niſities or formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though never ſo notoriouſly accuſed. And Sir, for Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and others of you, ſo often to call me notorious Traytor as you do: I tell you Sir, you reproach me, for though I am never ſo notoriouſly accuſed, yet in the eye of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> I am an innocent man, yea as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as any of thoſe who call me Traytor, till ſuch time as I be legally convicted of the fact or crime laid unto my Charge, and therefore Sir, I beſeech you ceaſe your calumniating of me, for you thereby deale not fairly nor ſegally with me. And Sir, I confidently hope, I ſhall appear in the eye of the Law, in the eyes of you, and in the eyes of all men that hear me this day, an innocent, a juſt, and a true <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> that really loves the welfare of his native Country, if I may have faire play, and the ſcope of the Law. And therefore Sir, blemiſh me not in the eares of the auditors, till the Law, and a conviction by it do blemiſh me; for I tell you, I am in the eye of the Law, as innocent as any of your ſelves till I be juſtly convicted; and therefore I pray ceaſe the calling of me Traytor in this manner.</p>

                  <p>By your ſpeeches you ſeem to bind me up to a ſingle plea. Truly I conceive that is not equitable by the law of God and the Lawes of Reaſon: No mans life is to be deſtroyed by nicities and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; yet contrary to your ſolemne promiſes, you take all advantage againſt me by them, (and make my ignorance in the tickliſh formalities of the law, to be the means of my own deſtruction,) although before I plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you ingaged unto me you would take no advantage by my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in your formalities, and my miſtakes in them, ſhould be no diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto me, and yet now I have pleaded, you ſeem to hold me cloſe to a ſingle plea. Truly, Sir, I think that is not juſt nor faire ſo to break your promiſes, and by faire words to ſmooth me on into nets and ſnares, and to make uſe of my willingneſſe to be tried by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> to drill me on to my own deſtruction: Truly, Sir, had I ever thought or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, I ſhould have been denied counſell, I would have died before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I would in any manner have pleaded to your charge, or have yeelded to your ſmooth inſinuations.</p>

Therefore you are now before us charged with the fact, and every mans conſcience knowes whether he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the thing charged upon him, or no, and your ſelfe does know whether you be guilty of that you are accuſed of, or no.

But Parliament men told my wife and friends, that my chiefeſt crime was correſponding with the Prince; and to defend my ſelf againſt that, I fitted my ſelf, never dreaming that onely books ſhould be laid to my charge; and therefore I could not, as to that come prepared; and therefore do humbly deſire Councell, a Copy of my Indictment, and time to bring in my Witneſſes.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I begge of you but one word, though I doe not know any reaſon why of my ſelf I ſhould not have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law, as well as any man in <hi>England;</hi> yet beſides, what yeſterday I alledged for my ſelf, for to have Councel aſſigned, yet to day give me leave to mention an unqueſtionable Preſident for my purpoſe, and that is Major <hi>Rolfe,</hi> who being an Officer in the Army, and being lately indicted for High Treaſon (before the Lord Chief Barron <hi>Wilde,</hi> that now is at <hi>Hampſhiere</hi> Aſſizes, for conſpiring to poiſon and piſtol the late King, which by Law was the higheſt of Treaſons) did conceive himſelfe in regard of his ignorance, unable to defend himſelf ſingly, againſt his enemies deſigne, which was to take away his life; whereupon he becomes an humble ſuitor to the Lord Chief Barron <hi>Wilde,</hi> that he might have Councel aſſigned him, and the Court before ever the Grand Jury received any teſtimony againſt him to find the Bill, aſſigned him Councel, who as I underſtand were one Mr <hi>Nichols,</hi> now a Judge of this Bench, and ſitting there; and Mr <hi>Maynard</hi> of the Temple, they were both aſſigned his Councell, and from Mr <hi>Maynard</hi> himſelf I have it, yea, from his own mouth: who being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Councel, they came into the court, where the grand Jury was called before the Judge: M. <hi>Maynard</hi> and M. <hi>Nichols,</hi> now a Judge here, had liberty there to be in the open Court, where the witneſſes before the Indictment was found, was called and in open Court was ſworn, and in open Court gave in their Evidence before the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:165485:27"/>Grand Jury, Major <hi>Rolfes</hi> Councell being by in open Court, to hear all the Evidence that was given againſt Major <hi>Rolfe,</hi> who in his Indictment was Indicted for two matters of fact, the firſt was that he had declared that in ſuch a moneth, and at ſuch a place, he had an intent to Piſtoll the late King; which by the letter of the Law of the 25 <hi>Edw:</hi> 3. <hi>chap:</hi> 2. was Treaſon: then there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Charge, that ſuch a day he had ſo ſaid or declared to Poiſon Him, in the preſence of ſuch a one, and they were both put into one Indictment; whereupon Mr <hi>Maynard,</hi> being aſſigned by the L: Chief Barron <hi>Wilde,</hi> that now is, to be of Councel for <hi>Rolfe</hi> in the ſame Caſe (but with abundance of more advantage to him, that I am now in) Mr <hi>Maynard</hi> was then of Councel to the priſoner, and had liberty to hear what the witneſſes ſwore againſt him, and to make his beſt advantage of it, and that in open Court, before the Indictment was found by the Grand inqueſt; and although there were two expreſſe witneſſes againſt him, yet but one of them ſwore to one thing, and another to another; Mr <hi>Maynard</hi> being one that knew the Law better then Major <hi>Rolfe</hi> did himſelf, he applied the two Statutes of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, <hi>viz.</hi> the 1 <hi>Edw:</hi> 6. <hi>chap:</hi> 12. and 5. and 6. of <hi>Edw:</hi> 6. <hi>chap:</hi> 11. to <hi>Rolfes</hi> Caſe, which Statutes doe expreſly declare. That no man ought to be convicted of Treaſon, but by two ſufficient witneſſes upon plaine and clear evidence to each fact of Treaſon, which evidance, as Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> ſaies in third part of his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> ought to be as clear as the Sun at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and not upon one ſingle witneſſe, and upon conjecturall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, or inferences, or ſtraines of wit: Now Sir I am an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man as well as Major <hi>Rolfe,</hi> and I have been an Officer in the Parliament Army as well as he, and there fought for them as heartily as ever he did in his life, and he was accuſed for the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treaſons; and therefore I humbly crave that in regard there are many particular errours in the Indictment, as to matter, time &amp; place: that therefore in reference to the illegality of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment according to this Preſident, by one of your own fellow Judges, that you would according to my birth-right, declared in Major <hi>Rolfes</hi> Caſe, aſſigne me Councell as he had, to help my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that ſo I may not be deſtroyed by ſurpriſall, and illegall, and unjuſt prerogatives.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, You have heard the Indictment read unto you, and you have heard it opened unto you, and you have heard what Mr.</hi> Lilburne <hi>ſaies, that he did not plead not Guilty, and I hope he is aſhamed of his Plea, now he heares the Indictment opened unto him. My Lord, in this Indictment there is contained theſe ſeverall Grand Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt is, that he hath adviſedly, traiterouſly, and maliciouſly publiſhed, that the Government that is now eſtabliſhed, by way of a free State or Common-wealth, without either King or houſe of Lords, is tirannic all, uſurped and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; and further, that the preſent Parliament now aſſembled, arr not the Supreame authority of the Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond is this, that he hath plotted, contrived and endeavoured, to ſtirre up, and raiſe forces againſt the preſent Government, and for the ſubversion and alteration of the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>The third is this that relates to the Army, you have heard what his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have been, and they have been read unto you, concerning them and the reſt, that he, not being an Officer or Souldier or member of the preſent Army, hath offered to ſtir up mutiny in the Army, and to withdraw the Souldiers from their obedience and ſubjection to their ſuperiour Officer, and thereby to ſtir them up to mutiny and diſcontent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe are the maine parts, and ſubſtance of what I intend to Charge him with in the evidence, to prove that which was contained in the Indictment. My Lord, you have heard in what hath been read out of the Indictment, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions they are, thoſe that are traiterous to the publicke, and have been ſo declared, ſo judged, ſo executed, theſe are here Mr Lilburns engaged true friends; the Parliament, the Government, the Authority, of both Parliament and Army, they are Tyrants, Vſurpers, Mercenaries, Janiſaries, Murderers, Traytors, ſtanding by their own power and ſwords, and ever-ruling all by their Wills; theſe are the expreſſions that he hath uſed. My Lords, I ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with any thing of agravation; for my Lords, I do conceive, that the reading of the Bookes themſelves aggravates every thing againſt him; and I thinke there is no</hi> Engliſh-<hi>man</hi> (<hi>as Mr.</hi> Lilburn <hi>ſo often ſtiles himſelf to be</hi>) <hi>will own ſuch words or acts as theſe are.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And truly my Lord, if I had read the Books, and not known the perſon, I ſhould not have thought he had been either a Chriſtian, or a Gentleman, or a Civill man, to have given ſuch baſe and bitter language; but my Lords, and you of the Jury, I ſtall hold you no longer the evidence being ſo plaine, and the matter ſo foule, that it will not admit ouer much ſtand in need of any diſpute, and to make it plaine and cleere to your judgements, and Conſciences, there is Witneſſes in the Court evidently to prove every thing that will ſtand in need, to be proved for the Indictment.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords, the words are maliciouſly, adviſedly and traiterouſly, I ſhall not catch at words, but as himſelf ſayes, what he prints is of mature, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate conſideration, and ſuch are his books in print; that himſelf hath either printed, or cauſed to be publiſhed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt that he is Charged withall, is that which is called</hi> An Out-Cry, <hi>it hath a very dangerous Title, and in the Direction eſpecially to the Souldiers of the Army, but eſpecially to the privat Souldiers of the Generalls Regiment of horſe, that helped to plunder the true hearted</hi> Engliſh-<hi>men, traiterouſly defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at</hi> Burford, <hi>ſo that the Rebels at</hi> Burford <hi>were Mr.</hi> Lilburns <hi>deare friends. My Lord, it hath not only a dangerous Title, but was publiſhed at a dangerous time; yea and for a dangerous end, which was to ſtir up the great mutiny that was in the City of</hi> Oxford. <hi>My Lord for the proof of this, we ſhall offer this, That</hi> Mr. Lilburn <hi>himſelf was Capt.</hi> Iones <hi>aſſociate in the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:165485:37"/>that Booke; For</hi> Mr. Lilburn <hi>and this Capt.</hi> Iones <hi>brought this Booke to the preſſe to be Printed, we ſhall offer unte yon where he hath publiſhed it to Souldiers of the Army, to engage them in a mutiny, and diſcontent againſt their ſuperiour Officers; therefore in the firſt place call</hi> Thomas Newcombe.</p>

And I further entreated him, if he could direct me, where I might buy ſome more of them: I have a friend ſayes be in ſuch a place, if you would goe to him, and tell him that I am here, I ſhould thinke my ſelfe beholding to you; Now the places name was</hi> Martins lane, <hi>bub the man's name whether I went, I have forgot, and the man too, I never heard of the man before nor ſince, ſo I told Mr.</hi> Lilburn. <hi>Now he ſaid to me, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when you find that man, you may have ſome more of the bookes; now theſe were the words to my beſt remembrance and knowledge, as I deſire to ſpeake with a pure conſcience.</hi>

In ſeverall places of that book he owns this as his book, viz.</hi> The legal fundamental liberties of <hi>Engl.</hi> revived, &amp;c. <hi>He calls it mine, and his ferementioned booke: and in his</hi> Salva Libertate, <hi>he owns it again, gives it the very date, and the very Title that is in this Booke: my Lords, we have done with this. My Lords, now</hi> I <hi>ſhall goe on to make uſe of it, and to ſhew my Lord out of theſe books, his words and language, to make good the Charge that hath been read in the indictment againſt Mr.</hi> Lilburne. <hi>My Lords, if you pleaſe for that</hi> I <hi>ſhall begin firſt, in reading to the Jury the very Act it ſelfe, which makes the fact to be Treaſon.</hi>

                     <hi>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, you hear, what ſtuff this of</hi> Mr Lilburns <hi>is, yea, ſuch ſtuff as that it would make any man loath to hear it: The laſt clauſe of the Act is, if any perſon not being an Officer, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, or Member of the Army, ſhall plot, contrive or endeavour to ſtir up any mutinies in the Army, or to withdraw any Officers or Souldiers from their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their ſuperior Officers, or to the preſent Government; It is high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you have here the ſeverall books read to you, and the Calumniation laid upon the chiefeſt of them to ſtir the reſt up to mutinies againſt them, but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:165485:59"/>they are very well known, and therefore nothing that</hi> Mr Lilburn <hi>can ſay will ſtick upon them, to their prejudice. But my Lord, you ſee here and you of the Jury, how he appeals from the Officers to the Souldiers interrogates, to know what they could do, and whether they will acknowledge they will own them, &amp; not fight againſt them, and what aid and aſſiſtance they will give to him and his friends, againſt their own General, and the reſt of their Superiour Officers; You ſee alſo what he calls that noble Generall, that all the world doth honor, &amp; his fame wrings through the world, and yet he cals him a grand Tyrant, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the power of his own will, and a ſtrong ſword, a deſtroyer of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the Laws and Liberties of</hi> England, <hi>you ſee what he cals the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers: Furies and Mercinary Jannizaries, which none but Turks have. You have heard the ſeverall charges proved unto you, for my part I think it is as clear as noon-day. We have not raiſed any advantage upon any ſlipping words that have ſlipt from him, which we might have done, and I could I have urged ſome more witneſſes, to have proved his books, publiſhed by him, to publick view, though when he comes in the face of the publick Court of Juſtice, he will not own them, which ſhewes his deſign to be the more dangerous; he will writ, print, publiſh be ſputter, and reproach: yea, and raiſe Tumults and Rebellion in a Clandeſtine way, but if we chance to queſtion him therefore, he will not own it, you ſee we have been fain to fetch it out of the fire, and yet this is one of</hi> Englands <hi>and its Liberties valiant Champions.</hi>

                  <p>I beſeech you, hear me a few words, they deſire to have it along with them. Sir, with your favour, I ſhall humbly crave Liberty to ſpeak a few words, I ſhall keep me cloſe to that, which is my right and my duty, and that is to the matter of Law in my Indictment, there are many things put into the Indictment by the Teſtimonies of Witneſſes now ſworne, that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be acted in ſeverall Counties, whether that be according to Law or no, I do not know, whether you will judge it ſo or no, but ſure I am, if either thoſe expreſſe Statutes, that I have already cited to the Jury, or the third part of Cooks Inſtituts be Law, I ought not to be tryed for Treaſon, but by a Jury of the next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hood, in the ſelf-ſame County, the fact is pretended to be committed in, and therefore it is very queſtionable to me, whether my Indictment be legall, for that it chargeth me with facts of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, committed in three ſeverall Counties, and that being matter of Law, I deſire Counſel to argue that point in the firſt place, there are alſo a great many other exceptions I have to make againſt the Illegallity of the Indictment, and having particulariſed one, I humbly crave that which is my Right by Law, that I may have Counſel aſſigned unto me, you have ſaid, you will do what ſhall become ingenious and underſtanding men, and juſt Judges in it, and therefore I crave leave according to my undoubted Right, to have Counſel aſſigned to plead in matters of Law to the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of the Indictment, and particularly, to that point I have nominated. There are alſo a great many things ariſes out of the matter of act, that will be points of Law likewiſe, and ſome of them appear to be ſo, there was never two clear and poſitive wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to one fact ſworne againſt me, but to moſt of the particular Treaſons, there is but one a piece, and I cannot yield that to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall but queſtionable in Law which I deſire Counſel to diſpute: I know not any of all the books fixed upon me, but the out-cry that hath two plain witneſſes to it, &amp; yet it is not ſworn that I am the Authour of it, the State of the firſt is this, that I was at the Printers before the Copie was taken away, &amp; that I gave one of thoſe books to a ſouldier: to ſum up the Notes of the matter of fact, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath been indeavoured to be proved, is to hard a task to be done by me imediatly, &amp; therefore I conceive is but juſt for you, to aſſign and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:165485:60"/>me counſel, to agree with the Counſel againſt me, what are the points of fact upon the proofe, from which the points of law are to be deducted, and whatever you, that call your ſelves my Judges, may think of this, yet I hope and verily believe, that theſe my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt fellow Citizens, that are the Gentlemen of my Iury, who have (there by) as men, the the iſſues of my life and death in their hands, and will think it but a juſt and rational motion and requeſt, and therefore before them again, I deſire to have Counſel aſſigned to plead in Law, to the errors of the Indictment, and alſo to the law ariſing upon the fact; this with a larger priviledge, was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one of your own brother Judges, to Major <hi>Rolfe</hi> laſt year, as his right by law; and I doe again appeal to Mr juſtice <hi>Nichols,</hi> then one of <hi>Rolfs</hi> Counſel for the truth of this, I pray ſpeak Sir, is it not true? <hi>but the Judge ſitting as if he had neither life nor ſoul, Mr</hi> Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn <hi>further ſaid,</hi> I hope Sir, it doth not enter into your thoughts preſently to put me to an undigeſted, extemporary anſwer, to ſo large an Indictment as that is that hath been read againſt me, that it is impoſſible for any mans brain, if it were as big as the biggeſt Magazine in <hi>London,</hi> to carry it in his head; and Sir, I hope you doe not conceive that my memory is of a greater largeneſſe then the greateſt Magazine in this City; you engaged unto me when I plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded firſt to my Indictment, that you would not take exceptions nor advange againſt me, for my ignorance in the fomralities of the law; I deſire you to make good your promiſe now unto me, and aſſign me Counſel to help my ignorance, that ſo the Counſel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me and my Counſel may agree, as I have ſeen it done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in the caſe of Duke <hi>Hambleton,</hi> upon the points of fact, from which law is to be deducted; and if you pleaſe to grant me this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and equitable favour, I ſhall think my ſelfe very much obliged unto you; without which juſtice, I cannot conceive upon what ground it can be apprehended I can go on, for my time and ſtrength now it is ſo far ſpent, that I conceive you cannot thinke my body is made of ſteel, to ſtand here four or five hours together ſpending my ſpirits to anſwer ſomany as I have to deal with, and be able after all this, to ſtand to return an anſwer to above five hours charge, and that upon life, when it ſeems you will ſuffer me to mend no blots; I hope you doe not lie upon the catch to weary and tire me out, by putting more upon me then a horſe is able to endure, and then goe about to hange me, becauſe I through tired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, want bodily ſtrength and abilities to make and pronounce my defence.</p>

                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:165485:60"/>Sir, to my apprehenſion, there does ariſe upon the matter of fact divers diſputes in law; I beſeech you therefore allow me my right in law, by aſſigning me Counſel to help me where I am ignorant, and you ſhall ſee I ſhall doe that which ſhall become an ingenuous and rationall man, and I will put my ſelf clearly upon the Tryall of the Country or my Iury according to the law.</p>

                  <p>Wee ſhall ſee that by and by; but I ſhall proceede on to anſwer your proofe to the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that in the ſame method that your Witneſſes ſwore: And therefore Sir, in the firſt place, to the firſt, which is THOMAS NEWCOME, the PRINTER, hee ſweares in theſe words: That I was preſent with CAPTAINE <hi>JONES,</hi> from whoſe hands hee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:165485:65"/>he ſayes he received the laſt ſheete of the Booke, called the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry of the Young men and Apprentices of <hi>LONDON;</hi> but hee ſaies Captaine <hi>Jones</hi> agreed with him for the printing of it, and not I; for in that particular hee doth not in the leaſt accuſe me, neither doth hee in the leaſt accuſe mee in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the world of being the Authour of it: and that I did any more at his houſe, but take away a ſingle ſheete of it before it was corrected, which ſayes he, I brought away with me: In anſwer to whoſe Teſtimony I returne this, and I earneſtly entreate you, Gendemen of the Jury, to obſerve it well, and therefore in the firſt place hee is but a ſingle Teſtimony to this: But ſecondly I anſwered, that hee confeſſes moreover, that before hee had compleated that ſheete that hee received from Captaine JONES, he was taken, and not onely hee, but his Formes alſo was taken from him: ſo that by his owne confeſſion, that Copy that was brought by Captaine <hi>JONES</hi> when I was preſent with him, proved abhortive, it was never wrought. For hee ſayes it was taken before hee had perfected it, and to my knowledge they had it in their poſſeſſion: ſo that it clearely appeares, it was never perfectly wrought off, and therefore the bookes were never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; Therefore I hope that it will not be Treaſon in mee, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a free man of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> to walke the ſtreetes with my friend, and to goe into a houſe with him where hee hath buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to doe, admit it bee a Printing houſe, where hee intends to have a ſheete of paper printed, his affaires, buſineſſe, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are nothing to mee, neither are they now in the leaſt laid unto my Charge: And if they were, as they are not, yet that ſheete miſcarried, and was taken before is was perfected: ſo that truly Sir, you may goe ſeeke the Printer of it, for you ſee that miſcarried that Captaine <hi>JONES</hi> delivered to the Printer in my company, and that ſheete which hee ſaith I had away, was an uncorrected one, which could ſerve mee for no other uſe, but waſt paper, and cannot bee adjudged to be a true Copy of that which was contained in the Indictment; neither doth hee or any other ſweare, that at the Printers they ſee, or know where was done the Tule of that <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T-CRY,</hi> contained in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that for any thing the Jury knowes, the firſt part of that Booke hath no dependance upon the ſheete that was ſpoyled, and not brought to maturity in Maſter <hi>Newcomes</hi> hand, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:165485:65"/>upon his Oath declares: ſo that truly Sir, in Law Mr. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi> Teſtimony proves nothing at all againſt me, as to that book mentioned and contained in the Indictment, and therefore you Gentlemen of the Jury, my life is in your hands, I beſeech you take notice, that in all his Teſtimony, there was not one word that he declared to accuſe me to be the Author of that Booke, or that my name was to it; for you ſhall finde the names of tenne that own it, ſo that I think his Teſtimony is gone, and is not worth a ſtraw.</p>
                  <p>In the next place there were three Souldiers, viz. <hi>John Tooke, Thomas Lewis,</hi> and <hi>John Skinner,</hi> that ſweares againſt mee, the ſubſtance of all their Teſtimonies centers in one: and <hi>John Tooke</hi> in the firſt place ſaith, about ſeven weekes agoe he met with Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonell <hi>John Lilburne</hi> in Ivy-lane, where <hi>Lewis</hi> knowing of him, gave him a ſalute: and they being glad to ſee him that he was well in health, and the like, out of friendſhip went to drink a cup of beere together at the Red Croſſe in Newgate-market, where he ſaw a Booke called the <hi>Apprentices Out-cry,</hi> given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Maſter <hi>Lewis,</hi> and he heard theſe words uttered by Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Lilburne,</hi> You ſouldiers are thoſe that keepe us in ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The ſecond witneſſe being <hi>Thomas Lewis,</hi> ſaith, That the 6. of <hi>December,</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> for ſo was his words, he met me in <hi>Ivy-lane,</hi> and tooke acquaintance of me, asked me how I did, and I thank'd him: and hee further declares, that hee was very much refreſht to ſee me, that I was well, and in health, and was glad to ſee that thoſe things that were given out of me, by common fame, (that I was killed or dead, that they were not true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being my old acquaintance as he ſaith, we went to drinke a cup of beere together; and ſayes hee (as hee remembers) Lieu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:165485:66"/>onely hee ſaith, I told him, that if hee went to ſuch a man, whoſe name hee hath forgot, it is poſſible hee might buy ſome more of them, for they were publiquely ſold all over the City; ſo that you Gentlemen of the Jury may take notice that hee declares the things by common ſame w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t the moſt that can be fixed upon mee, is, that I had one of them given mee, and I gave it to a Souldier, my familiar friend, who had a great deſire to ſee it, and was going to buy one of them, being publique up and downe <hi>LONDON</hi> at that time, which is all that hee doth charge upon mee; onely hee ſayes further, that there was a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: but his Teſtimony doth not reach to accuſe mee of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill or malicious Counſell given them, or any aggravations of ſpirit, as though I did incenſe him of them againſt their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or fellow-ſouldiers, thereby to ſtirre them up to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Rebellion. For truely I have made it my werke, for to be as ſparing in my diſcourſe as could be, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of any belonging to the ARMIE; yea, and to ſhun comming nigh the place, if I can avoid it where they are: and hee ſaith I had no aggravating ſpirit within mee, nor uttered any provocations to make them riſe in mutiny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Officers, and there is none of them all that does in the leaſt fixe that Booke upon mee, to bee mine, as the Author of it.</p>
                  <p>Only he ſaith further, that upon his declaring hee longed to ſee the Booke, that Lieutenant Colonell <hi>LILB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RNE</hi> told him that ſuch a man, whoſe name hee hath forgot, might poſſibly ſell them ſome of them if they had a mind to them or to get ſome of them, and truely I dee not believe that Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>Further he ſayes, all the worſt diſcourſe I had with them, was, that I asked them a queſtion, which was, when they had any pay, and they told me they had not had any pay in 5. weekes, and that was the worſt of all; there proceeded from me no aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting expreſſions upon it, or mutinous provocations, but truely
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:165485:66"/>that this diſcourſe ſhould come within the compaſſe of Treaſon, to ask my old acquaintance a queſtion, that had often times viſited me, when I was the Lords priſoner in the Tower, or to drink a Cup of beer with him, or give a ſheet and a half of paper, that was publickly ſold; Truly I hope there will be no righteous Jury in the world, that will give a Judgement againſt me for Treaſon therefore, no, I hope for more righteous Juſtice, from a Jury of Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> whom I hope to find men of Conſciences and Judgement, yea, of ſuch righteous Judgement, as that they will abhorre to go about, to take away my life, and my bloud, and lay the blemiſh and ſtaine of Treaſon upon — me and my poſterity for ever, upon ſuch a thing as this is, and this is all, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all, that the Evidence doth witneſs againſt me. Then in the third place, there was <hi>Iohn Skinner,</hi> who was the third: and he ſayes the ſame in effect and no more, and therefore I need not to go upon that any further, but ſhal leave it I hope to the inlivened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of my Jury, my fellow Citizens of <hi>London:</hi> in the next place, the ſecond thing layd to my charge, is the <hi>Salva Libertate,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Lieutenant of the Tower as he ſayes;<note place="margin">The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the Towers Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</note> Now truly the Lieutenant of the Tower is but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle witneſſe to this, and the Law ſaith poſitively, there ſhal be two legal witneſſes, to prove every Fact of Treaſon, whoſe Teſtimonie or evidence ought to be as clear and evident as the Sun at noon-day, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturall preſumptions or inferences, or ſtraines of witt, and truly the Lieutenant is but a ſingle witneſſe at moſt. I ſhould be loath to reproach or beſpatter the man, yet I muſt ſay this, being upon my life, that he is not onely a ſingle witneſſe, but a Gentleman, in whoſe Cuſtody I was priſoner contrary to Law; who kept me pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in times by-paſt, above 12. moneths together at the houſe of Lords illegall command, contrary unto Law and Juſtice, for which above a year ſince, I did commence at the Common Law an Action of four or five thouſand pound againſt him, as I did alſo againſt Collonell <hi>Tichbourn,</hi> that I have ſeen upon this bench, ſitting as one of my Judges which I think, is not equall nor juſt, nor legall that he with whom I have a ſuit of four or five thouſand pound depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, when thereby my profeſt adverſary ſhould be one of my Judges, and therefore I deſire he may be commanded off the bench, and withdraw as being my profeſſed adverſary, and therefore in Law uncapable to be my Judge, and truly having the ſame Action
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:165485:67"/>depending ſtill againſt the preſent Lieutenant of the Tower, before the Judges of the Kings Bench, for his detaining me in priſon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a year together, contrary to Law, he is thereby in the eye of the Law, my proefſſed Adverſary, and therefore in Law cannot be admitted, as a compitent witneſſe againſt me, upon my life, yet the Lieutenant of the Tower doth not in the leaſt ſwear that the hand is mine, or that he did ſee me write it; but onely he ſaith that I did deliver ſuch a Paper to him, but he is but a ſingle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo I ſay by the Law of the Land, not vallid or good, but his Teſtimony is clearly gone, and wiped off, as alſo all things that doth depend thereupon; There is beſides five or ſix witneſſes produced to ſeverall charges; but the Law expreſly ſaith, that there muſt be two plain and clear witneſſes to every particular Charge, or Fact of Treaſon, that muſt take away my life, and this is your own Law, and therefore he is but a ſingle one, and therefore invalled and altogether not ſatisfactory, or binding; and then beſide, which is conſiderable, truly I think the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> in the place where he ſaith, I gave him thoſe Papers, is not within the Juriſdiction of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and how I ſhould come to be arraigned by a Jury of fellow Citizens here in <hi>London</hi> therefore, againſt whom I muſt confeſſe that for my part, I have nothing for their Honeſty and Integrity to object, I know not, for I know not the faces of any two of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore impoſſible for me to ſay any thing againſt them; I ſay, I know not how by a <hi>London</hi> Jury I can be tried for a Fact fixed upon me, to be committed in <hi>Middelſex.</hi> I beſeech you Gentlemen of the Jury, miſtake me not: for I have nothing to accuſe you of, and I hope you will be ſo conſcientious and tender in the Trial of me for my life, that you will put your caſe as my caſe, and do by me as you would be done unto by me, if you were in my caſe and condition. And the righteous God of heaven and earth direct you ſo to do: and therefore the Lieutenant of the Tower being but a ſingle witneſſe at moſt, and in Law not a compitent, one neither, being my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Adverſary, that hath moſt illegally kept me in priſon, for which I have commenced long ſence my action at law for my legal reparations againſt him; I ſay, therefore in the eye of the Law, his Teſtimony ſticks not; and I pope in the righteous Opinion of my Jury, can do me no harm; and if ſo his Teſtimony be invalled, then the <hi>Salva Libertate</hi> can not reach me, to do me any hurt, but it and all thoſe my pretended books called by my name, are all
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:165485:67"/>waſhed away and gone, and my Adverſaries muſt go ſeek new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours for them, or at leaſt procure new and better Teſtimony to prove them mine, for that which they have produced hither to, is worth nothing. Then the next is <hi>Thomas Dafferne,</hi> and he ſayes that the twelfth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1649.<note place="margin">Thomas Daf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferns <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>
                     </note> he met with <hi>Lieut. Col.

Now truly he is but a ſingle Teſtimony, and he ſweares nothing particularly as to me, and beſides, what he ſweares is to a Fact done in another County, and therefore his Teſtimony is not worth a ſtraw; it's gone, it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallid in Law, it ſignifies nothing, it is not ſo good as a ſpiders webb; by Viritue of which the Marſhals Teſtimony and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of <hi>Warwick</hi> Caſtle, as alſo <hi>Col.

                        <hi>The Teſtimony of</hi> James Nutley, <hi>and</hi> Edward Raddon.</note> is that when I was before their Maſter, upon the 14. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1649. at his chamber in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be examined by him, they ſay, they ſaw me deliver a preparative to an Hue and Crie after Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerige</hi> to this maſters hands, and tell him, that that was mine, and I would own it, ſaving the Printers Errata's, which ſayes the Lieutenant of the Tower upon his oath, I expreſſed to be many.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer ſo which I ſay, I do not know whether the Temple be with in the Liberties of <hi>London</hi> or no, and if it be not, I know no ground in Law, wherefore a <hi>London Jury</hi> ſhould try me here: but more fully, I ſay, for any thing the Jury knowes, or for any thing the witneſſes ſwear, the Printers Errata's, which are many, are all and every of thoſe clauſes that offence or exceptions are taken againſt, for not one of thoſe clauſes which you except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, are not proved to be the Prinetrs Errata's, and therefore there is no validity or weight in thoſe Teſtimonies alſo, for they do not prove in the leaſt that any ſix lines of the Book is mine, all of them ſay that I owned no more of the Book then was free from the Printers Errata's. And the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Tower ſweares that the clauſe was added, which are many: And therefore you the Gentlemen of the Jury, I I appeal to your Conſciences, and to your Judgements, and the Lord ſet it home to your underſtandings, that you may not be guilty of the bloud of an innocent man, by partiality, fear or off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightment of ſpirit, for in law, Equity and Juſtice all their three Teſtimonies put together, has no validity, no ſtrength, nor force in them, and ſo much for that.</p>
                  <p>The next thing fixt upon me, is the legall fundamentall Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people of <hi>England,</hi> revived, aſſerted and vindicated, and truly all that's brought to prove the legal fundamental Liberties of <hi>England</hi> to be mine, is but mearly the relations that are in the fore-mentioned Books, for I do not remember, (nay I am ſure of it,) that there is ſo much as a ſingle Teſtimony that does give in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evidence againſt me that it is mine, and therefore I can anſwer to that nothing, more then what I have ſaid already. The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies all being invalled at leaſt in the eye of the Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that's gone too, and blown away as chaff before the wind.</p>

                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:165485:68"/>Laſtly, for the Agreement of the people, truly that's dated the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1649. And truly for ought I know, and I am ſure of it too, it is before the date of any of thoſe Acts upon which I am indicted for my life, &amp; therefore not within the compaſſe of it: for <hi>Paul</hi> that great Apoſtle ſaid, and he that ſpoke by the ſpirit of God that dwelt within him, &amp; to whom it was given in an extrarordinary manner, that ſo he might thereby be enabled to write the infallible truths of God, ſaid where there is no law, there can be no tranſgreſſion, but that Agreewent was in being &amp; publickly abroad with a legal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primatur to it, before any of the Acts, upon which I am arraigned, had a being, and therefore admit it ſhould be granted to be mine, yet it can be no tranſgreſſion or any thing prejudicial in the eye of the Law unto me, but beſides, there is not any Teſtimony at all, that ſo much as layes it to my charge to be mine, and therefore it pinches me not, nor does any of all the reſt of your charges, and beſides all that I have already ſaid in my owne behalf, to ſhew in Law the invalidity, and inſuffiencie of all the Teſtimony, you have produced againſt me; I add this, by way of addition to it, that there hath not been ſo much as one ſingle witneſſe or Teſtimony to prove that the Books laid to my charge, are rightly and truly dated, and not <hi>poſt</hi> dated, which if any of them or all of them ſhould be, admit the proofes were ſufficient in law, yet unleſſe the dayes of them be firmly proved to be exactly according to the original copies, and not <hi>poſt</hi> dated, for any thing the Jury knows, they might be made and write before ever the Acts, they are ſaid to tranſgreſſe, had a being. And therefore if there were ſo many Teſtimonies in Law, to prove the books mine, (which there is not in the leaſt) yet, I ſay admit, there had been a thouſand witneſſes to the proofe of every one of thoſe books, yet not withſtanding in the eye of the Law: I leave it to the Conſciences of my Jury, whether I be not free in that particular, ſeeing there is none ſweares punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and poſitively to the dates of them, but to put all out of danger, as I denie nothing, ſo in that particular, I do not own a jott, a line, a word, a ſillable, of any of them. Now Sir having done ſo far as I have, and clearly diſcovered to the Jury, and all that hear me this day, that all the proofes alledged againſt me, does not ſtick in the leaſt any guilt upon me, truly I have clearly anſwered, &amp; invallodated all the verball proofes, according to the clear letter and true intention of the Law, I have no more to ſay to all the evidences, that have been read in books againſt me, I leave

For</hi> Mr Lilburne, Actus non facit reum niſi mens rea: <hi>The Act of a man does not make him guilty, unleſs his mind be guilty; But I pray, how ſhall any man know the guilt of a mans mind but by thoſe polluting and poyſonous words that comes out of his mouth? that's the mind, what I hear a man ſay, I may lawfully ſay, he thinks; and it is a rule in Law, that the outward Acts do ſhew forth inward intentions, that very rule I will not ſpeak it in Latin, becauſe I ſpeak to one that does ſay, he does not underſtand Latin; otherwiſe I could ſpeak more Latin; now here is the matter, whether or no upon the whole Evidence that you have heard, there does not appear ſufficient matter to make this Priſoner guilty, not of raſh but of adviſed and deliberate Treaſon, and as plainly of plotting and contriving to raiſe Mutiny and Sedition in the Army, thereby totally, to ſubvert and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the preſent Government, and truly, I have not heard more of skill has been uſed, and more Attempts made then I think you have heard, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I doubt not, but as you will take care of the life of a man, that you
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:165485:77"/>muſt not take away the life of an innocent, ſo you will be as carefull of your own Souls, and the publick Safety, and that's all that I deſire, and I pray God to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you for the beſt.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall at preſent make no application for my ſelfe, onely I ſhall adde a few more of his lines toward the concluſion of his Argument, in page 415. which I hope cannot be offenſive, being ſpoken by him that was ſo eminently authorized thereunto, where he ſaith to the Lords:</p>
                     <p>Truly my Lords, theſe vexed worne people of the <hi>North,</hi> are not ſuitors to your Lordſhips, to regulate this Court (of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi>) or to reforme the Judges of it, but for extirpating theſe Judges, and utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing this Court: They are of <hi>Catoes</hi> mind, who would not ſubmit to <hi>Caeſar</hi> for his life, ſaying, he would not be beholding to a Tyrant for injuſtice; for it was injuſtice in him to take upon him to ſave a mans life, over whom he had no power: which Court of ſpeciall <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> was abſolutely and totally aboliſhed, by that excellent Act that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> being the 17. of the late King. <hi>Anno.</hi> 1641.</p>
                     <p>But Sir, if it ſhall be objected againſt me, that you are neceſſitated to take ſuch an extraordinary courſe with me, as a ſpeciall Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> is, becauſe I will not own your Authority: yea, and if you ſo continue, to deale with me as you dealt with the late <hi>King.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which at preſent I anſwer, firſt, the <hi>Kings</hi> Caſe and mine is different; for he refuſed to anſwer to his Charge, principally out of this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, becauſe he had inherent in him an old received principle (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in his Anſwer to the <hi>Petition of Right, Anno.</hi> 1627. and in many of his <hi>Declarations</hi> made ſince the beginning of the late Warres, and by his Speeches at his death; by vertue of which, he judged himſelf as not lyable or capable of being judged by any power on earth, but onely by God alone, and as being in any ſence not in the leaſt for any action he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:165485:80"/>did (though in it ſelfe never ſo vile) ſubject to the puniſhing part of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Now for my part, I do not in the leaſt refuſe to be tryed out of that conſideration, for I acknowledg my ſelf but a bare <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> ſubject to the Lawes thereof, as well in the penall, as in the directive part of them; unto the ordinary rule of which, with all my heart, I am willing to ſtoop, and I wiſh my adverſaries would do the ſame, and then I believe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie would not long laſt betwixt us.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing, betwixt my adverſaries and my ſelfe, there is a difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the legality and juſtneſſe of power, which in ſome late printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and popular diſcourſes, is made uſe of againſt me, as though I had a ſelfe conviction in mine own Conſcience, of my own guilt, and therefore do ayoid, as much as in me lies, a Tryall.</p>
                     <p>To take off which, and to lay my ſelfe and my adverſaries nakedly, and fully open, to the judgement and cenſure of all ingenuous and rationall men in <hi>England,</hi> I do hereby under my Hand and Seale (for that end it may be ſhewed to your houſe) proffer you, beſide what I lately proffered Mr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> which is contained in the 18. and 19. pages of the ſubſtance of that diſcourſe now in print, and here incloſed, that I am willing and ready, if they pleaſe, to chuſe one of your own twelve Judges, that ſit in one of the three publick Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and all or any of my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſhall chuſe which of the eleven remaining they pleaſe, and I will freely and voluntarily oblige and bind my ſelfe under my Hand and Seale, before Witneſſes, to ſtand to their finall and abſolute determination, (upon the principles of Law, for all differences betwixt them (or any of them) and me, although it reach to baniſhment, loſſe of eſtate, limb or life; ſo my adverſaries will do the like.</p>
                     <p>Provided, the hearing may be open, publique, and free, indifferently for both parties, and that the Judges give their judgment in writing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Hands, with their reaſons for their ſo doing, to every point of their judgement. And provided, I may for my own benefit, uſe, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, chooſe two friends freely to take, as well as their pens will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, all that paſſeth <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> without danger to their perſons, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties or eſtates; or without hazard of having their papers (by force or Authority) taken from them, and this I think is as faire as any rationall man under Heaven can deſire, and which I cannot believe, you can judge to the contrary; eſpecially conſidering it is ſo conſonant, to that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rule of the Sonne of God, <hi>(Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> contained in the Scripture (the volume of truth) <hi>viz.</hi> to do as you would be done to, which is the ſumme of both the Law and Goſpel, and of all righteouſneſs amongſt men.</p>

                           <p>THat although Lieut. Col. <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> your Petitioners brother and husband, by his late actings hath incur'd the diſpleaſure of this hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable houſe; yet ſince God hath ſo ordered humane affairs, that 'tis inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his people, though of reall integrity, and of hearty deſires of good to the Nation, to differ about the means, times, and ſeaſons requiſite, for the accompliſhing thereof, we hope your wiſdomes will put the moſt favourable interpretations to ſuch differences, and not to attribute them to any evill intention or deſign, but an over-earneſt longing for ſuch a perfect ſettlement of this Common-wealth, which time onely, and further opportunity can afford us.</p>
                           <p>We humbly conceive, he hath formerly given ſufficient proof of his faith and fidelity to his Country, by his former ſufferings, both before this Parliament when he bore teſtimony againſt Regal and Epiſcopal tyranny, and ſince alſo, in the frequent expoſing his life to the utmoſt of dangers in your ſervice; in all which, he did manifeſt, that the temptations of this world were not able to ſhake his integrity, and that for the enjoyment of any outward emoluments, he could not forſake the dictates of his own conſcience; and though we could heartily wiſh he had forborn thoſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:165485:82"/>things, which have drawn upon him his late ſufferings, yet are we well aſſured, and that upon the neereſt and ſtricteſt ſcrutiny we can make into his heart, that no indirect ends, or worldly allurements, have engaged him therein; a manifeſt argument whereof, we humbly conceive to be, for that neither the urgency of his neceſſities, which have been very great, and which are uſually very perſwaſive to men not guided by conſcience; not yet the importunity of dear friends, which have not been wanting, and yet not any whit reſtrained there-from; and therefore we hope this honourable houſe will diſtinguiſh betwixt weakneſs and deſign, and think of ſome way of moderation towards ſuch, as inſtigation of conſcience, and errour of judgment, have brought into your diſpleaſure.</p>
                           <p>And though the obligation of our particular relations, cannot but move us to this addreſs on his behalf; yet we humbly conceive, it will not only occaſion much ſadneſs to many of your friends, but much more joy to the common enemy to ſee his ruine: Yet conſidering his principles are a burthen to this State,</p>
                           <p>We do therefore moſt humbly preſent our aſſurance and confidence of his purpoſe, to withdraw himſelf into ſome forraign Country, deſiring he may have his money, which is neceſſary to his and his Families ſubſiſtance in their tranſplantation, and convenient time to prepare himſelf to go, and he will wholly betake himſelf to his particular duty and Calling, and that thoſe of his judgment who are free to go along with him, &amp; have arrears due to them from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> may have their arrears paid unto them, and be permitted accordingly to tranſplant themſelves, humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring this honourable houſe to take the premiſes into ſpeedy and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration, and laying all his former merits, faithfull ſervices, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, ſtripes, bonds and impriſonmets, with hazard of life, and loſs of eſtate, in oppoſition to Regal and Epiſcopal <hi>tyranny</hi> in ballance to his late miſcarriages, to do therein <hi>(out of your wonted mercy and clemency)</hi> as may be moſt for the glory of God, fruſtrating the longing deſires of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy to ſee his ruine, rejoycing and ſatisfying the Spirits of many of your friends; and for anſwering the humble and moſt earneſt requeſt of your Petitioners, whereby they ſhall be for ever engaged</p>

                           <p>Every one believing, That in a very ſhort time after the expulſion of the greater number of the Members of this honourable Houſe (as betrayers of their truſt) A new Repreſentative ſhould immediatly have been ordered, according to that Moddell of an Agreement of the People, tendered by the Councel of the Army, or in ſome other way: And that becauſe that honourable Councel in their Declaration of <hi>December</hi> laſt, Declared, <hi>That they ſhould not looke on the remaining part as a former ſtanding power to be continued; but in order unto, and untill the introducing of a more full and formall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a juſt Repreſentative to be ſpeedily endeavoured,</hi> by an Agreement of the People.</p>
                           <p>And we were the more confident hereof, becauſe they had formerly declared alſo, <hi>That where the Supream Authority was fixt in the ſame Perſons du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their own pleaſure, it rendered that Government no better then a Tyranny, and the People ſubject thereunto, no better then Vaſſals: That by frequent Elections men come to taſte of ſubjection as well as Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>
                              <pb n="163" facs="tcp:165485:83"/>And truly when you had voted the People under God to be the originall of all juſt Power, and the choſen Repreſentatives of the People, the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, we conceived that you did it to convey thoſe Righteous Principles (which we and our friends long laboured for) to the next full and formal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, and not that you intended te have exerciſed the ſupream Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making Power.</p>
                           <p>Much leſſe, that ſuch enſnaring Lawes ſhould ever have iſſued from a houſe of Commons, ſo often and ſo exceedingly purged, (intentionally by the Army) for the freedom of the Common-wealth, as is your Act againſt Treaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contrary to the courſe of former Parliaments, and to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are made Treaſon, that it is almoſt impoſſible for any to diſcourſe with any affection for performance of promiſes and Engagements, or for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Nation, but he is in danger of his life, if <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Juries</hi> ſhould take it for good Law, which God forbid.</p>
                           <p>Alſo your Act for continuance and receipt of Exciſe (which every one hoped upon the prevailing of the Army, would have had a finall end) to Trade more oppreſſive then all the Pattents, Projects, and Shipmoney put together.</p>
                           <p>Alſo your Act for continuance and ſtrict receipt of Cuſtoms was exceeding croſſe to expectation, that and the other for Exciſe, being eſteemed moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all kind of Commerce, Shipping and Navigation, and are ſo charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Receipt, as that if what is disburſed to Offices and Collectors were rayſed in an ordinary way of Subſidies, it would go very farre towards the publique charge, which it was hoped you would have ſeriouſly laid to heart, and have prepared a way to have eaſed the Nation of both, and to have raiſed all publique moneys by way of Subſidies.</p>
                           <p>It was hoped alſo, That you would have done ſomething towards eaſing the People of the <hi>long complained burthen</hi> of Tythes, rather then to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the ſame upon treble dammages.</p>
                           <p>It was alſo expected upon the prevailing of the Army, and the reducement of this honourable Houſe, That the Printing-Preſſes ſhould have been fully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and ſet at free liberty, for the clear Information of the People, the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of them having been complained of as a great oppreſſion in the <hi>Biſhops</hi> times, and in the time of the late unpurged <hi>Parl.</hi> rather then ſuch an Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all unlicenſed Printing, Writing or Publiſhing, as for ſtrictneſſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity was never before ſeene in <hi>England,</hi> and is extreamly diſſatisfactory to moſt People.</p>
                           <p>And truly when you had declared ſo highly <hi>&amp;</hi> reſolvedly for the maintenance of the Law of the Land, as to the defence of every mans Liberty and Property according to that excellent Law of the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> you may ſoone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what heart-breaking <hi>&amp;</hi> torment of ſpirit was occaſioned by, your ſeizing in an hoſtile manner ſuch conſtant cordial Promoters of thoſe excellent Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes forementioned, by the commitment of them in an extrajudicial manner to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:165485:84"/>an Arbitrary Priſon, where they have been long time Priſoners, and moſt of that time cloſe priſoners, their Chambers and Pockets ſearch'd more then once, to find matter againſt them (things altogether unparliamentary) yea, denied a legal Tryal, no legal Crime being laid to their Charge, nor Accuſer or Witneſſe ever ſeene by them face to face, as Law requires; and this to the Ruine of themſelves and Families, as to temporall ſubſiſtance: We profeſſe we are not able to expreſs the grief and amazement that ſeized on us thereupon, and which is daily renewed upon us, in that, now after extream provocations, you ſeeme Reſolved to take away the life of our dear friend Mr. <hi>Lilburn,</hi> and others, not by any ordinary way of Trial at the uſuall Aſſizes, but by a ſpeciall Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> the Judges being compoſed of ſuch as whoſe intereſt he hath long oppoſed; a way much complained of in the corrupt times before this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and which we hoped we ſhould have heard no more of in this Nation</p>
                           <p>And although this is too too lamentable, yet would this were all; but if we underſtand the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> truly, the putting of Souldiers to death, or to other reproachful and painful puniſhments, by <hi>Martial-Law,</hi> in time of Peace, is not agreeable thereunto, and if we are deceived therein, the expreſs words of that Law have deceived us.</p>
                           <p>But that ſuch as have ventured their lives for you, and thought nothing too deere to be ſpent in defence of a juſt Parliamentary-Authority, ſhould yet be impriſoned (as ſome ſuch there are) in remote Caſtles, and uſed more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly then Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> in the <hi>Biſhops</hi> time, and how ſoone intended to be proceeded againſt, by ſpecial Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> (we cannot but feare:) This makes our very hearts to bleed, and our Bowels to earne within us; inſomuch as if no Reaſon, Conſcience, feare of God, or ſence of Religion will put a ſpeedy ſtop to theſe proceedings, but our moſt deere Friends (becauſe ever faithful to their Countrey) muſt thus be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined and ſlaughtered, under pretence of Tryalls; we ſhall not deſire to breath longer in this World, as ſeeing nothing but miſery and ſlavery like to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them.</p>
                           <p>What a ſad thing, we beſeech you is it, that it ſhould be thus in this Nation, in the firſt year of <hi>Englands</hi> liberty (as you would have it eſteemed) which in our apprehenſion exceeds in miſery and thraldome, the worſt of <hi>Englands</hi> bondage.</p>
                           <p>For beſides what hath been mentioned, what is more frequent then to txa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine men againſt themſelves, to impriſon men by Votes of Committees, to ſeize upon mens perſons by Purſuivants <hi>&amp;</hi> Meſſengers, to ſweare men againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Taxes and Impoſitions never ſo high, and Souldiers (not civill Officers) ſet to gather them, to the terror of the people; and upon the leaſt deniall, either violence or an Impriſonment certainly enſueth: Lawyers in effect are ſaid to
